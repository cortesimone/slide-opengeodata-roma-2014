A presentation for OpenGeoData by Simone Cortesi, and Maurizio Napolitano

### HTML5 Slideshow Template
Based on the reveal.js HTML5 presentation template:
- A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).
reveal.js comes with a broad range of features including [nested slides](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup), [markdown contents](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown), [PDF export](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export), [speaker notes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) and a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api). It's best viewed in a browser with support for CSS 3D transforms but [fallbacks](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support) are available to make sure your presentation can still be viewed elsewhere.
